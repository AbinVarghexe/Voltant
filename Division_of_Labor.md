## General Guidelines

- Each developer is responsible for the full development lifecycle (front-end and back-end integration where applicable) of their assigned sections/screens.
- Strictly adhere to the Figma design specifications: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/uJPmckMV5bVtjsu1R9Ml7f/Voltant-Energy---Incial?node-id=0-1&t=2CwklyUl7McPeQWH-1) and [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/uJPmckMV5bVtjsu1R9Ml7f/Voltant-Energy---Incial?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=6-2&viewport=626%2C350%2C0.11&t=HuQv3Apx0tacmeAx-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=299%3A310&show-proto-sidebar=1).
- Use Figma in **Dev Mode** for accurate implementation or follow the design as is.
- Download all necessary assets directly from Figma for use in development.
- Ensure the website is fully responsive, paying special attention to the **Mobile View** section in the Figma design.
- Maintain high code quality and collaborate effectively to ensure seamless integration of all components.
- Document progress and issues in the projectâ€™s Git repository.
